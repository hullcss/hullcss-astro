## The Framework

The website is built [#withastro](https://astro.build/), 
a fairly new, simple and powerful framework that allows you to build frontend sites and client-side applications.
I chose this because it's super fast, and it's super easy to use 
and I can use components written in other frameworks like react and svelte
allowing me to use components that I have already written in other projects.    

### Components

Most components are written in Astro, 
but when making more reactive components (like the text typing effect on the homepage),
I used [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). 
Astro makes it really easy to use components from other frameworks such as svelte and react. 

### Blogposts

For the blogposts, I used the MDX library for Astro. It allows me to write posts in a markdown-like syntax 
while givig me the ability to use components and other features that are not available in regular markdown.

### Styling

For styling, I mostly used Sass (more specifically SCSS) to style the website.
I chose this over other options bc its close enough to CSS that I can use it without much of a learning curve, 
but it also has some great quality of life features that make css so much more bearable to use. 

#### Theme

For the colours, I chose to use [OneDark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui). 
A theme originally created to be used with the Atom text editor, 
but has since been ported to many other applications and tools. 
I chose this because I love the colours and I think it looks great 
(if you look at my github, youll see that a lot of my other projects use this theme too lol). 
I have tweaked the colours a bit just to make the theme more flexible. 

## Hosting prodivder

For hosting, I chose to use [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/),
a serverless platform that allows you to build, host, and scale your website or web application on the edge. 
I chose this because it's free (up to 250k reqs/day) and it's super easy to use.
It also has an integration with GitHub, so I can just push to my repo and it will automatically build and deploy my site for me.
