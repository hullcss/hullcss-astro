# This is an example Blogpost

This is an example blogpost. You can edit this file to create your own blogpost.

This uses markdown, so you can use all the usual markdown features. 

## draft

If you set `draft: true` then the blogpost will not be published. If you set `draft: false` then the blogpost will be published.

if someone tries to access a draft blogpost, they will get an unauthorised error, once draft is set to false, they will be able to access it.

to access a draft post, put "?draft=true" at the end of the url.
